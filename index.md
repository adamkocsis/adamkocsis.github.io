# Welcome to Evolv-ED! 

The Evolv-ED is an online journal and wiki-style platform for educational material about the **resources** used in evolutionary sciences.


> "Do more science... just really weird, f\*cked-up sh\*t... stuff where even you're like: 'Man, I shouldn't have done that'... do that!"


- Hub of information for the sustainable development of knowledge. It takes longer and longer to familiarize with the complex needs of tools and data.

- Curated list of educational material.

- In its current state, the Evolv-ED is an informal journal.
